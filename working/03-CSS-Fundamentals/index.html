                    All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.
                </p>
                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                <p>
                    HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <!-- ol stands for Ordered List. needs li (List Item) elements as children. -->
                    <li class="first-li">The opening tag</li>
                    <li>The closing tag</li>
                    <li>The actual element</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <!--Links use the <a> (anchor) element. Using the target="_blank" lets you open link in a new tab by default. -->
                    You can learn more at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <!-- ul stands for Unordered List. needs li (List Item) elements as children. -->
                    <li class="first-li">To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
                    <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
                    <li>To build web applications</li>
                    <li>To impress friends</li>
                    <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>

                 A: Usually we never use IDs. Use classes in case we want to add
                    more elements with that class. -->
